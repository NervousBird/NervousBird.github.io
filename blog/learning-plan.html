        <h4>Long Term Career Goal</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to be a developer, someone who understands what that means, and is capable of creating anythingUltimately, creation is always my end goal. Being able to understand things at a fundamental level iimportant to me, and I think important in the current market, with A.I. being so fucking rampant, deep <b><i>understanding</i></b> is crucial in creating and keeping a career in this field.
        </p><br>
        <h4>After-Foundations Update!</h4>
        <p>
          The 5 week foundations part of the course is almost at an end, so I wanted to add this addendum:
          <br>Something I missed to add to this learning plan, that I think, after these few weeks, is important to add: I want to learn confidence and understanding with human skills, I have struggles with social anxieties, and know how important it is in this field to have strong social skills, not only to find and keep work, but to also stay sane and avoid burnouts. I want to improve this skill and feel very confident going into the workforce.

        <h4>My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
          One of my biggest strengths is also my biggest limitation, as clich√©'s go. That is; passion, I enjoy learning and creating tremendously, and will put significant time and effort into persuing things, and not just persuing, but learning, growing, and perfecting. The flip side of this, is that I have <i>many</i> passions and have struggled to keep them all well balanced. My hopes with building a career, is that I will be able to explore my passions without stress of <i>monetisation</i>, which will leave me free to create what I want while having a (hopefully) steady income, and the consistency of work, that I can enjoy. 
        </p><br>
        <h4>After-Foundations Addendum:</h4>
        <p>
          Another limitation I have become aware of that I will need to overcome: Vocalising! I am bad at speaking up, taking lead or charge in situations that I can, and asking for help in situations I need it. There's too much fear of failure, and too much worry about doing things "right", or "perfectly". This is something that needs to be worked on!

        <h4>Skills I'd like to develop</h4>
        <p>
          Specificity with the non-technical/human skills make this a difficult answer for me. Although the focus osocial skills, and self learning also seem extremely interesting and (hopefully) very helpful! So to be able to answer the question, I will say those two things are skills I'd most like to develop.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Addendum:</h4>
        <p>
          Communication with others, especially in team situations, or with potential bosses, is something I would like to develop and have confidence with before finishing the course.

        <h4>Workload and Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          I have been aware of the potential workload of this course since before joining. It is not something I worry too much about; for the next few months, studying and working will be my main focus, the entire point of doing this course for me, was to be forced into a fast track learning developer skills.<br> I understand other people have limitations, and may require accomodations, which is something I am completely capable of! Even if the workload is something I can manage, I understand that it may not always be the case, for me, or others. Communication is key with this. If things are getting too much for me (or for others), a clear conversation about what exactly is <i>too much</i> and what the needs are around this is the best solution. There is very rarely no solution if everyone is willing to talk and listen.

        <h4>Skeeing Help</h4>
        <p>
          This is an important subject. It's important to seek help sooner rather than later, while learning to navigate and overcome problems is an important skill, you can also learn that in a fraction of the time with just <b><i>asking</i></b>. I know that the team is around to answer questions, and help, and that it would be sill to struggle on my own. When (not if), I come into issues, I will seek help from the team quickly (not immediately), to stop myself from being stuck anywhere too long.

        <h4>Facilitator Expectations</h4>
        <p>
          Expectations are not something I generally think about. Timely help, friendliness, and patience are what come to mind. Which seems so obvious it's strange to state, I have no worries that these expectations will be met all. I suppose the last thing would be, clear and deep knowledge, as I am trying to learn, I would hope and expect the team to be able to answer questions I have with clear answers.

        <h4>Other Commitments</h4>
        <p>
          As I am married to someone who lives overseas, I have both a commitment to my wife, and to some adminstrative things in The Netherlands, this may lead me to not be available during strange hours, but in general, it will not be an issue.
