        <h4>Long Term Career Goal</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to be a developer, someone who understands what that means, and is capable of creating anythingUltimately, creation is always my end goal. Being able to understand things at a fundamental level iimportant to me, and I think important in the current market, with A.I. being so fucking rampant, deep <b><i>understanding</i></b> is crucial in creating and keeping a career in this field.

        <h4>My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
          One of my biggest strengths is also my biggest limitation, as clich√©'s go. That is; passion, I enjoy learningand creating tremendously, and will put significant time and effort into persuing things, and not juspersuing, but learning, growing, and perfecting. The flip side of this, is that I have <i>many</i> passionsand have struggled to keep them all well balanced. My hopes with building a career, is that I will be able texplore my passions without stress of <i>monetisation</i>, which will leave me free to create what I wantwhile having a (hopefully) steady income, and the consistency of work, that I can enjoy.

        <h4>Skills I'd like to develop</h4>
        <p>
          Specificity with the non-technical/human skills make this a difficult answer for me. Although the focus osocial skills, and self learning also seem extremely interesting and (hopefully) very helpful! So to be ablto answer the question, I will say those two things are skills I'd most like to develop.

        <h4>Workload and Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          I have been aware of the potential workload of this course since before joining. It is not something I worrtoo much about; for the next few months, studying and working will be my main focus, the entire point of dointhis course for me, was to be forced into a fast track learning developer skills.<br> I understand othepeople have limitations, and may require accomodations, which is something I am completely capable of! Even ithe workload is something I can manage, I understand that it may not always be the case, for me, or othersCommunication is key with this. If things are getting too much for me (or for others), a clear conversatioabout what exactly is <i>too much</i> and what the needs are around this is the best solution. There is verrarely no solution if everyone is willing to talk and listen.

        <h4>Skeeing Help</h4>
        <p>
          This is an important subject. It's important to seek help sooner rather than later, while learning to navigatand overcome problems is an important skill, you can also learn that in a fraction of the time with jus<b><i>asking</i></b>. I know that the team is around to answer questions, and help, and that it would be sillto struggle on my own. When (not if), I come into issues, I will seek help from the team quickly (noimmediately), to stop myself from being stuck anywhere too long.

        <h4>Facilitator Expectations</h4>
        <p>
          Expectations are not something I generally think about. Timely help, friendliness, and patience are what comto mind. Which seems so obvious it's strange to state, I have no worries that these expectations will be meat all. I suppose the last thing would be, clear and deep knowledge, as I am trying to learn, I would hope anexpect the team to be able to answer questions I have with clear answers.

        <h4>Other Commitments</h4>
        <p>
          As I am married to someone who lives overseas, I have both a commitment to my wife, and to some adminstrativthings in The Netherlands, this may lead me to not be available during strange hours, but in general, it wilnot be an issue.
