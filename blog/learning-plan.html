          <h4>Long Term Career Goal</h4>
          <p>
            I would like to be a developer, someone who understands what that means, and is capable of creating anything. Ultimately, creation is always my end goal. Being able to understand things at a fundamental level is important to me, and I think important in the current market, with A.I. being so fucking rampant, deep <b><i>understanding</i></b> is crucial in creating and keeping a career in this field.

          <h4>My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
          <p>
            One of my biggest strengths is also my biggest limitation, as clich√©'s go. That is; passion, I enjoy learning, and creating tremendously, and will put significant time and effort into persuing things, and not just persuing, but learning, growing, and perfecting. The flip side of this, is that I have <i>many</i> passions, and have struggled to keep them all well balanced. My hopes with building a career, is that I will be able to explore my passions without stress of <i>monetisation</i>, which will leave me free to create what I want, while having a (hopefully) steady income, and the consistency of work, that I can enjoy.

          <h4>Skills I'd like to develop</h4>
          <p>
            Specificity with the non-technical/human skills make this a difficult answer for me. Although the focus on social skills, and self learning also seem extremely interesting and (hopefully) very helpful! So to be able to answer the question, I will say those two things are skills I'd most like to develop.

          <h4>Workload and Collaboration</h4>
          <p>
            I have been aware of the potential workload of this course since before joining. It is not something I worry too much about; for the next few months, studying and working will be my main focus, the entire point of doing this course for me, was to be forced into a fast track learning developer skills.<br> I understand other people have limitations, and may require accomodations, which is something I am completely capable of! Even if the workload is something I can manage, I understand that it may not always be the case, for me, or others. Communication is key with this. If things are getting too much for me (or for others), a clear conversation about what exactly is <i>too much</i> and what the needs are around this is the best solution. There is very rarely no solution if everyone is willing to talk and listen.

          <h4>Skeeing Help</h4>
          <p>
            This is an important subject. It's important to seek help sooner rather than later, while learning to navigate and overcome problems is an important skill, you can also learn that in a fraction of the time with just <b><i>asking</i></b>. I know that the team is around to answer questions, and help, and that it would be silly to struggle on my own. When (not if), I come into issues, I will seek help from the team quickly (not immediately), to stop myself from being stuck anywhere too long.

          <h4>Facilitator Expectations</h4>
          <p>
            Expectations are not something I generally think about. Timely help, friendliness, and patience are what come to mind. Which seems so obvious it's strange to state, I have no worries that these expectations will be met at all. I suppose the last thing would be, clear and deep knowledge, as I am trying to learn, I would hope and expect the team to be able to answer questions I have with clear answers.

          <h4>Other Commitments</h4>
          <p>
            As I am married to someone who lives overseas, I have both a commitment to my wife, and to some adminstrative things in The Netherlands, this may lead me to not be available during strange hours, but in general, it will not be an issue.
