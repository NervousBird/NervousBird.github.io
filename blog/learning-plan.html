      <h3>What is this page about?</h3>
      <p>
        This is a page to clearly layout thoughts and ideas, and more specifically, plans for my time in the Dev-Academy course. There are two sections here, the first is a learning plan for the Bootcamp part of the course, the second part was an old learning plan for the Foundations part.

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          I want to find myself in a place that is safe, that I feel secure, with my work. This is, for me, the most important thing. I have a lot of passions, and wish to skill myself into a position that I am a valuable employee, and can have a comfortable work space, which will allow me to truly embrace my passions outside of work. It's been too long with thoughts of; "I'm wasting my time with this, I can't monetise this thing...", I want to get into development, coding, design, because I love those things anyway, and work somewhere I can enjoy, and feel secure.

        <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>
          I think my biggest strengths are my biggest weaknesses (doesn't it always work out that way?); I am very passionate, and very interested in a lot of different things. This leads to me having a long history of learning, self-teaching, and ability to understand things and develop quickly. It also leads to my biggest struggle: I can lose interest fast, things can get overwhelming, I find myself getting lost and/or burntout. Which has made sticking to things and reaching actual high levels of competency difficult and rare.

        </div>
        <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
        <p>
          Being consistent, managing time with people and others, and creating a good balance. There's a lot of moving parts for me, which I think is true for anyone, but I know that there will be a lot of emotional and physical struggles with keeping up, not only with the demands of the course and fellow students, but also with my personal situation.

        <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          I want to really develop a deep understanding of coding, and logical thinking, for one. That sort of, foundational understanding, that can allow me to pursue other languages, or other developer realms, without feeling like I have to start from 0 (or close to 0) again. In regards to human skills, I would like to feel confident with my ability to manage myself and my own time, and communicate confidentally to others, whether that's a coworker, or a boss. Feel sure of myself to take the lead and not push myself to the background.

        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          I expect passion, and a willingness to explain, talk, and help me understand things at a deep level. I like to really understand things at a fundamental level, and hope the team is capable and willing to meet me there.

          <img class="pigeon_7" src="/images/PigeonSquare_07.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>
          To commit to the workload, and the tasks being asked of me. I should not shy away from things that make me uncomfortable, and make sure that everything has been completed! I want to finish it all, with the sprints and extra work as well, and find a way to do all this without exhausting myself.

        <h4>Long Term Career Goal</h4>
        <p>
          I would like to be a developer, someone who understands what that means, and is capable of creating anythingUltimately, creation is always my end goal. Being able to understand things at a fundamental level iimportant to me, and I think important in the current market, with A.I. being so fucking rampant, deep <b><i>understanding</i></b> is crucial in creating and keeping a career in this field.
        </p><br>
        <h4>After-Foundations Update!</h4>
        <p>
          The 5 week foundations part of the course is almost at an end, so I wanted to add this addendum:
          <br>Something I missed to add to this learning plan, that I think, after these few weeks, is important to add: I want to learn confidence and understanding with human skills, I have struggles with social anxieties, and know how important it is in this field to have strong social skills, not only to find and keep work, but to also stay sane and avoid burnouts. I want to improve this skill and feel very confident going into the workforce.

        </div>
        <h4>My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
          One of my biggest strengths is also my biggest limitation, as clich√©'s go. That is; passion, I enjoy learning and creating tremendously, and will put significant time and effort into persuing things, and not just persuing, but learning, growing, and perfecting. The flip side of this, is that I have <i>many</i> passions and have struggled to keep them all well balanced. My hopes with building a career, is that I will be able to explore my passions without stress of <i>monetisation</i>, which will leave me free to create what I want while having a (hopefully) steady income, and the consistency of work, that I can enjoy. 
        </p><br>
        <h4>After-Foundations Addendum:</h4>
        <p>
          Another limitation I have become aware of that I will need to overcome: Vocalising! I am bad at speaking up, taking lead or charge in situations that I can, and asking for help in situations I need it. There's too much fear of failure, and too much worry about doing things "right", or "perfectly". This is something that needs to be worked on!

        </div>
        <h4>Skills I'd like to develop</h4>
        <p>
          Specificity with the non-technical/human skills make this a difficult answer for me. Although the focus osocial skills, and self learning also seem extremely interesting and (hopefully) very helpful! So to be able to answer the question, I will say those two things are skills I'd most like to develop.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Addendum:</h4>
        <p>
          Communication with others, especially in team situations, or with potential bosses, is something I would like to develop and have confidence with before finishing the course.

        </div>
        <h4>Workload and Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          I have been aware of the potential workload of this course since before joining. It is not something I worry too much about; for the next few months, studying and working will be my main focus, the entire point of doing this course for me, was to be forced into a fast track learning developer skills.<br> I understand other people have limitations, and may require accomodations, which is something I am completely capable of! Even if the workload is something I can manage, I understand that it may not always be the case, for me, or others. Communication is key with this. If things are getting too much for me (or for others), a clear conversation about what exactly is <i>too much</i> and what the needs are around this is the best solution. There is very rarely no solution if everyone is willing to talk and listen.

        <h4>Skeeing Help</h4>
        <p>
          This is an important subject. It's important to seek help sooner rather than later, while learning to navigate and overcome problems is an important skill, you can also learn that in a fraction of the time with just <b><i>asking</i></b>. I know that the team is around to answer questions, and help, and that it would be sill to struggle on my own. When (not if), I come into issues, I will seek help from the team quickly (not immediately), to stop myself from being stuck anywhere too long.

        <h4>Facilitator Expectations</h4>
        <p>
          Expectations are not something I generally think about. Timely help, friendliness, and patience are what come to mind. Which seems so obvious it's strange to state, I have no worries that these expectations will be met all. I suppose the last thing would be, clear and deep knowledge, as I am trying to learn, I would hope and expect the team to be able to answer questions I have with clear answers.

        <h4>Other Commitments</h4>
        <p>
          As I am married to someone who lives overseas, I have both a commitment to my wife, and to some adminstrative things in The Netherlands, this may lead me to not be available during strange hours, but in general, it will not be an issue.
