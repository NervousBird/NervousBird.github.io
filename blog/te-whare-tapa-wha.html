      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori perspective on health, it is a rather modern idea, and I'll be going over what they mean, and what they mean to me. So let's have a look.

        <h4>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          This is all about physical health, this can include a lot of things, not just the benefits that being fit and active can provide, but also the positivity that good food, balanced sleep, and hygiene.
          <br>This is something I agree with, it can bring massive benefits to mental health, being physical, eating healthy, and keeping a good hygiene. But I also don't think it's just about health benefits, eating a wide variety of food is not only the best for your phsyical health, it's fantastic for mental health, and I find, grows curiousity, excitement, and simple happy hormones. Same with hygiene, I always feel mentally much happier when I am feeling clean, and fresh! Exercise is something that everyone knows and is familiar with, but also, it can lead to a lot more than just feeling physically good. Having physical health can allow for more experiences, allows you to get into nature more, and connect with the world. Walking, biking, traveling, going to a gym with others, playing sports, all of this is great for both mental and physical health.

        <h4>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          This is all about feelings and thoughts. Mental health is tough, and can hugely impact your physical health, so it's important to have a good balance. Stress and anxiety are rampent in society, and they're extremely damaging to people's health, physical health as well.
          <br>To me, this is extremely important, and the emotional intelligence and mindfulness that we are practicing during the course are fantastic ways to help with your mental health. It's complicated though, sometimes the thing that is good for our mental health can <i>feel</i> bad. It's important to learn about yourself, and to not be afraid. Meditation, relaxation, even boredom, can all be very helpful and healthy. Having strong mental health helps you also be true to yourself, which is extremely important. Both physical health and mental health are very interlinked, and can have huge impact on each other. An inability to help your physical wellbeing can hurt your self image, and damage your mental health. Be kind to yourself, and be true to yourself.

        <h4>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          This is, for most people, about faith, and the abstract idea of connection.
          <br>A tough one for me, as I do not connect at all with the common ideas of faith, I have extremely negative feelings with religious organisations, and have seen this aspect used to often to abuse fellow humans. Tradition, beliefs, values, purpose, these are all extremely powerful tools, and have been repeatedly abused throughout history, and are continued to be used in horrific ways. 
          <br>The importance of this for me is; people matter, the earth matters, there is only one existance that we know of, and that we can affect. So it's important to try be a positive influence on that. We should be allowed to be our selves, but should not be allowed to impose ourselves on others. Everything we do is just choice and consequence, and I will try balance that as best I can to bring positivity to the world.

        <h4>taha whānau (family wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          This is family, but also extended family, friends, the idea of community. Humans are communal animals, connection with others is important, we help build each other up, we all contribute to each other, and this is important for wellbeing.
          <br>I care about people, and I try always to be around people that hold similar values to me. Together, we can make a better world for everyone, and I'm so fucking tired of this <i>hate</i> that people seem to have for others. It's too common for people to look at others they perceive as <i><b>below</b></i> them with disdain, or hate. This world grows and improves with connection and community, we have the power to help each other, and I will be trying to surround myself with people who view things this way as well. When I can I will also be trying to sway people away from these notions of judgement and hate. Love breeds love.

        <h4>whenua (land)</h4>
        <p>
          The world and land we live on is apart of us as well. Nature is the foundation of it all. Having a connection to the earth can help improve all kinds of wellbeing, physical and mental health have both been proven to improve when people are in nature. 
          <br>This is a fundamental importance to me, I love animals of all kinds, and the planet. Spending time in nature everyday is a goal of mine, and I hope to do more once I've settled in to living back in New Zealand.
