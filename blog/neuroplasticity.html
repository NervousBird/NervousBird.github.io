      <h3>It's like any muscle</h3>
      <p>
        Basically, you can work out your brain. The idea that you are stuck at a certain level, or that, after a certain age or time frame, that's it, you have now been locked in to what ever capabilities you possess, and cannot grow anymore is very outdated. But it's still the general idea, you'll hear this a lot! It simply isn't true, you can learn new things, you can reqire your brain, you can make it stronger and more capable.

        <h4>Exercise the brain</h4>
        <p>
          Just knowing that you can <i>actually</i> change your brain, work on it, and see benefits and improvements, itself, is a massive motivator. How do you do this though? Well, unfortunately it's not knew: practice. Do things, do them again, and again, and again, this will start to create and strengthen pathways in your brain, and you will see improvement. It's not just repetition though, it's active practice, something you will find in any master of their craft.

        <h4>Growing</h4>
        <p>
          What do I need to do though? Well, practice, but not just that, you need <i>feedback</i>, which allows you to adjust things. A consistent environment is also important, as you can't do proper practice with randomness. <br>There's no point in doing something over and over if you have no feedback, or that feedback is random, you want to be revisiting neural pathways again and again, not constantly creating new ones. So create a consistent environment, and get as much feedback as possible. Do this repeatedly, and your brain will start to strengthen pathways, and you'll find it gets easier.

          I also find this video to be very apropos, while it's not directly about neuroplasticity, it is interesting and helpful none-the-less.

        <h4>Let's make it happen</h4>
        <p>
          The idea of neuroplasticity and the fundamental things involved are things I am super familiar with, it's the foundation of study when it comes to things like art and music. I have spent a lot of time since I was about 14, studying classical guitar, and have been involved with art for my whole life. None of this is new to me, but it's still interesting to see the research and proven science.
