      <h3>Before we begin</h3>
      <p>
        Let's have a look at the basics of Javascript. The things you will <i><b>need</b></i> to know and understand to have success. It's very different from both <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, and can be quite difficult when you're first beggining. I'll be avoiding direct examples, and using a bakery analogy to explain the concepts, hopefull this will make it easier to understand!

        <h4>What is Javascript, and why, and maybe even how?</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. -->
           For those unfamiliar with coding, or development, the easiest way to sum up HTML, CSS, and Javascript is: HTML is the <i><b>information</b></i>, CSS is the <i><b>presentation</b></i>, and Javascript is the <i><b>action</b></i>. If we were to think about a website as if it's a door, HTML would be the wood, the handle, the lock. CSS is the paint on the door, the style of the handle, the trim and details. While Javascript is the mechanisms that let you open and close the door, lock and unlock it, the hinges and how the door opens and functions.<br><br>
           Javascript is the <i><b>doing</b></i>.

        <h4>Control and loopies</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those). -->
          Control flow and loops would be very confusing to hear, if you have no experience with coding, so let's explain them in a simpler way! A recipe, perhaps for cupcakes, in such a case, control flow would just be the order you read the instructions. A loop, then, is a set of repeated instructions, think; "add a small amount of water and then stir, keep doing this until you reach the desired consistency". That's a loop!

            Take this lovely pile of cupcakes! Gorgeous, but they've got no icing, and that is unacceptable in our house. We need sugar! Luckily we also have all this lovely icing here!

            Now let's make a simple <i>"recipe"</i>, or a loop, so we can get all our cupcakes iced!

            Now, this isn't <i><b>exactly</b></i> correct code, but the actual code is very similar. It's basic, but it works!<br>
            Simply click the icing to ice the cupcakes!

        <h4>Hanging out with the DOM</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. -->
           DOM stands for Document Object Model. Which isn't all that important, let's focus instead of what this means. Everything is an object, and objects can have other objects, it's objects all the way down! 
        </p>        
        <span class="technical-blurb-images">
          <img class="technical-prievew-image" src="/images/preview_DOM.png" alt="">
        </span><br>
        <p>
          It can seem overwhelming, but it's simply a hierarchy of things, these things contain other things. Each has their specific purpose, and where you place things is important, but it's really not that complicated. What's important to remember, is that things load in a certain way, top to bottom. Sometimes you'll want something loaded first or last, so be aware. <br><br>
          Learning to navigate the DOM is important though, as it's how you will be accessing everything with Javascript. If I grab one of the elements, say, then it will also help to remember and be aware of the things beneath it. Since the DOM works in a hierarchy, things bellow that are connected to an element, can also be affected.<br><br>
          <p style="color: var(--color-font-link)">document.querySelect()</p> is one of a few ways to access items in the DOM, if I were to grab the element a, from the above visual, then I could also have access to the text: <i>"link to cupcakes!"</i> as well as the attribute: <i>link</i>.<br><br>
          Keep this in mind when working with the DOM!

        <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
           Back to our cupcakes to explain this one. An array is just a collection of things, a basket of cupcakes, for example, while an object is a singular thing with a bunch of <i><b>properties</b></i>. They are very different, and both very important. Having a lovely <i><b>array</b></i> (basket) of muffins is lovely, but with that, all we know is that we have a basket, and it has cupcakes. But when we take a singular cupcake as an <i><b>object</b></i>, then we can get a hold of all it's juicy <i><b>properties</b></i>, think of these as info, icing, the flour used, the size, how soft it is, etc.

        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. -->
           Functions are basically specific baking instructions! They are usually very simple as well, as computers need to be told <i><b>everything</b></i>. You can think of something like <b>stirring</b> to be a function, or as in the example above; <b>icing</b>. It's a very specific task that can be done to ... something!

        <div class="bakery-example-container">
          <p>
            <!-- Step by step example of a function -->
          </p>
          <div class="bakery-visuals-container">
            <!-- stiring visual -->
          </div>
          <p>
            <!-- icing -->
          </p>
          <div class="bakery-visuals-container">
            <!-- Icing visual -->
          </div>
          <p>
            Simple, right?<br><br>
            Usually Javascript, like a bakery, will have <i><b>a lot</b></i> of little functions, and it's best to keep them simple! It makes understanding and following easier, to make some cupcakes, we may have some functions like:
            <ul>
              <li><b>weigh ingredients</b></li> 
              <li><b>mix ingredients</b></li>
              <li><b>put in tray</b></li>
              <li><b>heat oven</b></li>
              <li><b>bake</b></li>
              <li><b>take out cupcakes</b></li>
              <li><b>let cool off</b></li>
              <li><b>ice cupcakes</b></li>
              <li>and of course <b>eat cupcakes</b></li>
            </ul>  Imagine writing out very explicit steps that you would need to do for each of these functions, and you're basically coding already!
