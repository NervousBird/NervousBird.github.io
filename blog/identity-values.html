        <h4>Ethical Decisions</h4>
        <!-- Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the valuesinvolvedin that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision  now. -->
        <p>
          Struggling to think of any significant ethical decisions I have made. I think my decision to stop eating meat is the largest.<br> It's not something I am extremely pressed about, and is not because I am against all meat eating. I just feel, and am aware, of how the majority of meat and animal biproducts are created, and the consequences of those things. I hope that the world can move towards more sustainable, and caring (if you can ever call it that) raising and consumption of animals. <br>This decision, because I am not extremely harsh about it, hasn't affected me tremendously. Truly, I forget often that I don't eat meat, only being reminded of the fact when I am in society; at a cafe, or restaurant, or having dinner with others. Then I am made aware of the reality that most people don't even think twice about eating meat, or what happened to the creature they're consuming, whether they purchased something that had a fair life, or whether it was a brief torture<br> It's not a choice I regret, and will never go back on, but as stated, this is not a hard rule I have imposed on myself. I will eat meat if there is no alternative, and I will not feel guilt doing so. I just hope that avoiding meats and learning how to eat healthy and delicious vegan/vegetarian food, I can inspire others to enjoy it as well, and just ... eat fewer animals.

        <h4>Culture and People</h4>
        <p>This has been on my mind lately. Having grown up in NZ, obviously I was exposed to a Western culture. It wasn't something I really melded well with; it wasn't until I was around 30, that I learned I am autistic and ADHD. Which explained a lot of my hangups with the culture I grew up in.<br> Luckily, culture is something you choose, which I feel a lot of people confuse, and connect it too much with race. These two things, while statistically, may be very interlinked, are not linked at all. Culture evolves, it changes, and it is picked and chosen, and this, to me, is an extremely important point.<br> My family is all nuerodivergent, and at this point in my life, I think most of the people I surround myself with are as well. I found there is a lot more compassion, and freedom, with the people I like to be around, and it was something that felt lacking in our current culture.<br> The culture I grew up in, I think, also lead me to have a pretty deep aversion to making my own blogs. So this course will be very interesting.</p>

        <h4>Strengths and How They Support Me</h4>
      
        <p>I am an extremely curious person, and enjoy learning, which, obviously, is a great thing to have when you are learning. Logical thinking and creating are also things I am extremely interested in, and enjoy immensely,which are both skills that are good for developers to have. <br> The last thing I think will support me the most,that was an issue earlier in life but  isn't anymore; I am older and more mature, I know myself a lot better, my limitations, my strengths, and most importantly, ways to manage both those things. This, I think, will be the most important strength I have now, when it comes to learning.</p>

        <h4>Struggles and Limitations</h4>
        <p>I have ADHD and Autism. The former is the real problem, as it can lead to an intense inability to focus, and difficult struggles with demand avoidance. This can mean that, if there are certain obstacles ordifficulties inmy learning or working, it can become extremely tough to overcome. That can hurt me a lot as a lot of important, basic things, that are fundamental to what I am learning/doing, can very much trigger that struggle with ADHD,and  get in the way of me performing - or progressing - as well as I could, otherwise<br> Fun times!</p>

        <h4>Story Time</h4>
        <!-- Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was  resistanceortension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and  your reflections on whatotherstrategies you would try now and why. -->
        <p>During my times doing study, and in higher education in particular, I have encountered many situations where teamwork was required. It seems almsot ubiquitous across studies, that eventually, people will be forced together, and made to complete a task of sorts.<br> Years ago, when I was studying 3D animation and film, the penultimate assingment was a group project, where in we had to create, storyboard, design, animate, and composite, an entire short film. The film only had to be very short, 30 seconds or so, so the workload wasn't insurmountable. However, organising several young people into doing a single task, which required lots of clear communication, was a nightmare.<br> There was constant waiting times, terribly organised workloads,and rampant demand avoidance. This was all compounded as the assingment took place over a holiday period and over half thegroup went on holiday.<br> This wasn't something I was equipt to handle at the time, the assingment was failed, I had done my part, but others were not able to complete theirs. It's not something I regret, and I recognise now, that I couldn't have done things differently during that time, with the capabilities I had.<br> Now, however, I hope I could help the group more, work harder to facilitate communication between individuals, and try manage workload and tasks between the group a bit more evenly.<br> I have found that the biggest struggle with group projects, is how often members may not be able to work, at all, until another member has completed their task. Better management would have saved a lot of group projects<br> Time will tell if I'm correct and able with this.</p>
