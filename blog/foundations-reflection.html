      <h3>What is this blog even about?</h3>
      <p>
        The end of the foundations course is near, it's been almost 5 weeks since it began, and this blog is going to answer some thoughts on the human skills aspect.

        <h4>3 Things I've learned about me (and my ego, which is also me)</h4>
        <p>
          There wasn't a huge amount of learning for me during this time. I had already started a journey of self-discovery years ago, so, I haven't had any more moments of learning. It was a nice experience to continue that journey though, and have a lot of the things I had been thinking about and learning anyway be somewhat validated, and repeated, throughout the course.

        <h4>The roles of empathy and self-awareness amongst computers</h4>
        <p>
          It may seem at first that programming is all about logic, and knowledge, but having human skills and EQ is extremely important. Being a developer means that you will never stop learning, there's always new frameworks, there's always new developments. Having the ability to connect with people, and be a person who is enjoyable to work with, is more valuable than just knowing things. Learning is constant, and empathy and selfawarenes helps navigate struggles that may appear when you are needing to learn, or when others are needing to learn.

        <h4>Big surprise</h4>
        <p>
          There were no surprises for me, maybe it's combination of not having expectations, and also being the age I am, and having already spent a lot of time learning and looking into things like EQ. But I haven't had any big surprises.

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The biggest struggle for me, when it comes to the human skills learning, is finding time to do things like meditate. Having ADHD means that sitting and meditating for periods of time can be daunting, so the biggest struggle has just been forcing myself to do so.

        <h4>Why even care feelings? Computers don't have feelings</h4>
        <p>
          Why even do this? Isn't this all about coding? Well, no, it's been said time and time and time again, from many developers, and it's even more true now. Finding and keeping work in this field requires good human skills, and at the end of the day, we all want a job. These skills make not only finding a job easier, but keeping it, and not having yourself burnout doing the job. So it's as important to learn this, as it is learning how to just do the actual job.

        <h4>Was it all for nothing?</h4>
        <p>
          Not at all. As stated above, learning these skills not only will help find you a job, but most important, can help you manage having that job. Being a developer is actually one of the most stressful jobs around, with some of the highest rates of suicide. There's huge pressure to deliver, and outside of delevopers, most people have no clue how this job actually works. Which can lead to managers having unrealistic expectations, imposter syndrome pushing peope to do more than they can, and an ever increasing workload. Learning to navigate this in a healthy, confident, and effective way, is key to having a good work life.
