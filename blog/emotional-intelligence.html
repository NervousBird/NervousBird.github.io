      <h3>What even is emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        It is the ability to understand, and manage your emotions. Allowing you to manage stress, empathise with others, communicate effectively, overcome challenges, and handle conflicts. It's the key to a strong emotional health, and can also have a very positive impact on physical health as well.<br><br>
        EQ (emotional quotient, or emotional intelligence), can help you build good relationships, succeed at school and work, achieve goals in life, and fundamentally understand yourself; your needs, struggles, and the things that are most important to you.<br><br>
        Growing emotional intelligence can be done in many ways, one of the most common is something called; "Mindfulness", which is the practice of paying attention to the present moment. Being fully aware of yourself, your experience, your surroundings, without judgement. It can lead to reduced stress, improved focus, and many other health benefits.

        <h4>The Benefits of Mindfulness</h4>
        <p>
          Mindfulness can have benefits in both mental and physical health, reducing stress, and an improvement to overall happiness in life.<br><br>
          <strong>Improvements to Mental Health</strong><br>
          Mindfulness' focus on acknowledging emotions and accepting them can lead to a healthier mind. Learning to accept difficult feelings and emotions instead of avoiding or reacting to them can help with getting through them, and finding healthier habbits of management. This has lead to an increase in mindfulness meditation being used in psycotherapy to help in the treatment of: depression, anxiety disorders, couples' therapy, and obsessive compulsive disorder.<br><br>
          <strong>Improvements to Physical Health</strong><br>
          There has also been some proof that mindfulness techniques can have physical health benefits, including; a reduction in stress, treatment of heart disease, lowering blood pressure, reducing chronic pain, improving sleep, and alleviating gastrointestinal difficulties.<br>
          As stress is a huge factor in physical wellbeing, partaking in mindfulness meditation and/or other mindfulness practices can reduce stress, and help many physical health issues at the same time.<br><br>
          <strong>Happiness in Life</strong><br>
          There are huge benefits to overall happiness in life; by learning to accept and understanding feelings, and grow your emotional intelligence, practicers of mindfulness can see a tremendous increase in overall happiness. Higher levels of satisfaction, improved capacity to handle difficult situations, better management skills, stronger and deeper connections with others, improved leadership abilites, and many more.

        <h4>How though?</h4>
        <p>
          There are several ways to improve your emotional intelligence! The main attributes of a high emotional intelligence are: being able to recognise your emotions, capable of regulating yourself, empathy and understand others, social skills, and self-motivation.<br>Common ways of improving these traits are:<br><br>
          <strong>Mindfulness!</strong><br>
          We have already covered mindfullness, but what exactly IS it?<br><br>
          Mindfulness is the act of being aware of yourself, your surroundings, and others in the present moment. It focuses on understanding what is currently happening, instead of what has been, or what will be, without judgement (no "right" or "wrong").<br><br> It has roots in Buddhist meditation, but has been adopted in the West with a secular practice. It's main form has continued to be in meditation, but other forms of mindfulness are also valid, these include things like: journaling, yoga, walking, listening to people, visualisations, and many others.<br><br>
          <strong>Therapy</strong><br>
          Therapy can be a very helpful way to build EQ. Since a large portion of therapy invovles talking and exploring ones self, partaking in therapy can lead to a much greater EQ. A cornerstone to a healthy mind is understanding, and in our current society, people can be left feeling "wrong". Having a professional to talk to and help guide you in self-awareness, and potentially give answers to why you may be feeling "wrong" is invaluable. From personal experience, therapy has improved my own EQ tremendously, and while I'm still learning to implement my new understandings, the path is no longer so foggy and confusing.<br><br>
