      <h3>What even is emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        It is the ability to understand, and manage your emotions. Allowing you to manage stress, empathise with others, communicate effectively, overcome challenges, and handle conflicts. It's the key to a strong emotional health, and can also have a very positive impact on physical health as well.<br><br>
        EQ (emotional quotient, or emotional intelligence), can help you build good relationships, succeed at school and work, achieve goals in life, and fundamentally understand yourself; your needs, struggles, and the things that are most important to you.<br><br>
        Growing emotional intelligence can be done in many ways, one of the most common is something called; "Mindfulness", which is the practice of paying attention to the present moment. Being fully aware of yourself, your experience, your surroundings, without judgement. It can lead to reduced stress, improved focus, and many other health benefits.
